# click-params documentation

Everything you need to know about click-params.

## Why?

I often find myself wanting to use a click parameter able to handle list of strings, so I decide to put this in a library,
and I ended adding more parameter types that can be useful for various scripts including network, mathematics and so on.

## Features

With this project you have click parameter types related to:

- numbers
- network
- domain, url
- json, etc..
